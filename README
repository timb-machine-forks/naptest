Naptest- Not Another Pentest
This is (probably) the world's most awful pentest automation script. It does many things to just create a bash script which runs GNU parallel.

Usage:

$ python naptest generate <nmap XML file/folder containing nmap XML files> #Generates the services db/array/flat files from nmap
$ python testgen.py #Needs the services.array from the above command
$ bash CABO.sh #Congrats, you have pentested
